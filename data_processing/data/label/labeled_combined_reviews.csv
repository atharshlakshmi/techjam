Derrick Phillips,Three years ago I had a car accident and I needed immediate help to cover lost wages. Fast Funds swooped in to the rescue and advanced me money to survive. It is 3 years later now my case is settled and Fast Funds got their money back. I must say that 3 years without worrying about making a loan payment or getting collection calls is well worth the fee. I absolutely love what they did to help and would recommend them to anyone waiting on the evil insurance companies to make things whole again.,5,Valid
It's For Sale Main Account,"I wish I could give Jason and Fast Funds 10 stars for the Open & Honest way he conducted business with me.  The level of service was Exceptional.

There are many businesses designed to help people when they are in a less-than advantageous position.  Often, as customers in need of funds to sustain our living expenses we are desperate and have exhausted our resources leaving us few places to turn to and no power in the business relationship.

A businessman who suffered 3 heart failures over the last 18 months and the loss of my career as a result, this certainly was the case with me.

As a company, Fast Funds clearly understands their clientele and how to do this business right.

Design your business model in such a way that you are able to charge reasonable rates to your clients and still conduct business in a fair, ethical manner.

Hire good people with a high level of personal integrity and treat them with the same respect you insist they treat their clients with.  Pay them a wage sufficient to attract and keep quality employees and operate under a system that allows them to keep their integrity intact.

Jason was clear about the cost of the advance from the beginning.  The fee structure is easy to understand and there are no hidden charges or complicated scenarios to confuse the client.

As mentioned, the level of service was superb.  Highlighted by Jason's willingness to be helpful, answer questions, sometimes a little after hours.  He was clear about the process and what to expect without any hesitation that he may be held accountable for the statements he made.

I have been the owner of a service company with 30 employees and the manager of many others.  My name is Tom Hansen and I received my lawsuit advance December 17th, 2019.  My glowing review was earned each step of the way by Jason and the good people at Fast Funds of Hollywood, Florida.",5,Valid

Sister King,"To whom this may concern,
Recently, I was injured on the job. Stressed about apartment eviction and car/ insurance payments. These three are my biggest bills. After praying about my burdens, I then turned to my lawyer Mr. John Dufour. With his years of experience and affiliation with the company by the name of ""Fast Funds"" which are owned and operated by Mr. Bruce and Jason. Fast funds specializes in settlement cash advances. What does that mean? Its a financial relief for anyone who's injured. With that injury comes with a settlement offer. Well, from first hand it takes time to accumulate all the evidence in your situation. That's when hard times hit and you should contact ""Fast Funds"" where Bruce/Jason will be more than happy to assist you in your financial situation. If it wasn't for these three Angels I would be homeless, Literally! God places people in your life for a reason and these three Angels have been a blessing to my life. So stop worrying about what's already been solved. Go ahead and give ""Fast Funds"" a try Today!",5,Ad

If you have a question or need a recommendation to achieve the customization goal they can totally help you out. I bought new doors, bags, paddle tire kit and they all arrived before my big Thanksgiving trip to make my RZR look sweet. I highly recommend these guys for the huge amount of inventory, experience, and overall great prices, I can buy here without feeling the need to price shop other locations. Thank you to everyone at AO for all your help and you can betcha buns ill be back!",5,Valid

Seth Walker,"I have always admired AO's builds and had one day hoped to get my car in their shop for upgrades. Before I could do that, I ran out of talent and wadded up the front end on my RZR cracking the frame in the process. I called Alternative the following day (on a Sunday) and surprisingly James answered my call. He answered all my questions and walked me through the whole insurance process without even expecting me to bring my car to him. It was like we had known each other for years.

The shop is a couple hours from me but was well worth the drive. I ended up having a lot of problems with my insurance company dropping the ball and jacking me around. James was super patient, helped me out a ton with all the issues, was up front about every detail, and finally my RZR came back looking like nothing ever happened even with a full frame swap. They went above and beyond to clean up all my wiring that another ""shop"" had slapped together.

Their pics speak for themselves. Believe me when I say their work is very clean and thorough. Solid team of guys that do things right the first time. Extremely hard to find in this industry.

Highly recommend!",5,Valid

Charmian McKeown,"Horrendous experience

Ordered an expensive desk from Homary and was told 9 - 11 week delivery time. It took 21 weeks. I was very happy to wait and was very understanding due to the COVID situation however when the desk finally arrived, it was only one piece, with no legs! I was then told the remaining legs would arrive in 9 - 11 weeks again, but may be longer. I could not wait another 21 weeks as I work from home and have no where to sit!

I politely asked for a refund as I couldn't wait any longer and would just purchase a cheaper desk for now that could be delivered quickly.

I have only been refunded a partial amount and no idea why, as I should get the full refund - they are now ignoring my communications.

However the most frustrating and rude part of this process is that after my understanding for 21 weeks, I asked for the large/heavy piece of unusable desk they delivered to be picked up - I cannot move it and it is taking up my entire hall. I was told I have to ""dispose of it"". I explained it is too heavy and I can't afford to get someone to come and get it, I was then told to ""Ask family or friends to help"". I have no family or friends living near me and I found this so unhelpful and pretty assumptive and upsetting. It is now sitting in my hallway as a health and safety hazard, I am ¬£80 down as they haven't paid me a full refund and I have to order anew desk to work from after waiting 21 weeks.

I never review companies online as I understand mistakes happen but I wouldn't want anyone else to deal with this incompetent company.

Be warned!",1,Rant

jimmy renteria,"RUN! STAY AWAY!! This company came to my home after a pipe burst upstairs. I had water 2-3 inches deep in my home. They brought at least 6 fans and several extra humidifiers they charged insurance extra for which were never working. I locked my garage door from the inside so I could secure some of my valuables and they broke in while I was gone. They searched through my stuff and stole sodas and beer. They stole military service medals, sunglasses, and several other small items. When I confronted the head technician David Renteria, he said they broke into my garage to use the power outlet. They had also opened a case of sodas that were on a shelf nowhere near the outlet and taped the sodas together 2 at a time to prop fans up in the house. They're the most unprofessional company that I have ever dealt with. STAY AWAY! RUN!",1,Rant

Kirsten Reeder,"Our son likes making music, so we signed him up for a summer camp at Mix Major. He loved it! The teaching of skills and interaction with other kids was great for him. He's now taking weekly classes, has created several songs, and because of what he's learned and the confidence it's given him he created an entire album of music. We love that the students use professional software and are learning skills that are up to date and used is the music production industry today. Mr. Jao is also great at helping the kids learn, and making class fun. Can't say enough great things.",5,Valid
Kevin Toop,"I signed my daughter up for a mix major camp just to try something different. She fell in love and now takes a weekly class. I had no idea how much she would enjoy creating and remixing digital music. She gets to work on her computer skills, music skills, and general creativity. She even works on it in her spare time and she is super proud of the projects she completes. Eric does an amazing job and has a real passion for teaching. His unyielding positivity is inspiring and motivating. Mix Major is the best activity my daughter has done in her 11 years!",5,Valid
GRACE MARTINEZ,"Mix Major is a great music school! My son has learned a lot from Eric's professional musical prowess and has enjoyed every weekly lessons.  We are so fortunate that we have found this school, not only for its qualifications as a good music school, but because of its personal touch. Eric truly cares for his students and that's what makes him and his school so special.",5,Valid
George Cheng,"Our child has really enjoyed Mix Major's DJ'ing/music production program!  It started with a summer camp a few summers ago but since we are not local, we could not attend the regular weekday classes.  It was great to see Eric be so adaptive during the pandemic and really grow his online platform to allow our child to now attend the weekly classes.  There aren't too many silver linings from this pandemic but this is one of few.  It's neat to see kids with similar music interests from all over the country now in these classes.  Eric has also arranged, from time to time, extra workshops exposing the students to a variety of people in the music industry which gives the students a wider perspective of real life applications that are possible from these classes.  Our child in general would not sit still long enough to appreciate regular musical instrument lessons but this program has helped to increase the interest in music. Our piano is getting more use now and  there is a much higher level of excitement for orchestra class in middle school.  Who know where this class can take our child, but the new appreciation for music and instruments makes the program well worth it.",5,Valid
Katie,"My son started getting into electronic music using garage band and eventually Ableton. After seeing how he enjoyed making music, I scoured the internet looking for a school to teach that type of music and found Mix Major. We are so glad we did! Our son has learned so much and looks forward to class every week. After each class, he excitedly tells us how he has learned something new. Eric does a great job of pointing our son in the right direction to improve his music/project, always in a positive enthusiastic way. Mix Major is the best!",5,Valid
