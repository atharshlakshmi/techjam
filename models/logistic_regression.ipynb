      "Review: I just received my Clearlight Sanctuary 3 sauna. Was able to put it together with the help of my husband, directions are simple and clear.  It really is stunning to look at, the ambient lights give off a beautiful glow.  The chromotherapy and blue-tooth speakers are a fun touch too. You can create a mood with lights and sound. It heats up pretty quickly and keeps the temperature at the chosen level. The controls are easy to use and straight forward. You can make adjustments in the temperature/time/full spectrum light range. The bench is comfortable and can be flipped to completely flat or ergonomic style. When considering this purchase, I had A TON of questions for Julie and she was fantastic and prompt with responses if she didn't know right away.  She has also been available to answer my questions after I received the sauna about a myriad of things. I really appreciate her help.\n",

I can’t believe it became a reality... from the first call I had with you not knowing how I would be able to make this happen, to making the deposit, still not knowing how I was going to make it happen, to asking a zillion questions (no joke)... and still not knowing how I was going to make it happen, to finalizing payment and awaiting delivery (not believeing that I made it happen), to sitting in my sauna, my sanctuary... and realizing that healing is happening. Thank you, friend, through it all, for being you and being so intentional and wholeheartedly committed to health, wellness, education, inspiration, integrity and advocacy. You are so appreciated and valued. And my life is so much better having met you. I can it wait to continue this journey alongside you. Thank you a million times over.\n",

Throughout the past year we have had different people and things placed in our path that has really lead us to the progress that we are seeing (total God thing in our opinion) and Julie and Clearlight are two of the things that fell right into place for us. Someone online recommended Julie to me, I reached out and right away could tell that she was a book of knowledge. I got her on the phone with my parents. Julie spent hours on the phone with them (my mom can ask a ton of questions) and not once did they feel pressured. The sauna was ordered and came in a couple of weeks ago. I actually just got off the phone with my mother prior to writing this review and she is already seeing improvements with her pain. Infrared saunas was also recommended by two LLMD’s that my mom uses so it was an investment in her healing. I want to thank Julie for all of her help.

I battle with chronic pain and this is just the most amazing treatment for my pain. Each color light does something different, one treats infections while other help detox etc. Julie Bishop was the absolute best with her customer service.

We must have asked her questions on and off for over 6 months prior to being ready to purchase.  The being ready to purchase had more to do with cash flow than anything especially since Julie was SO prompt and thorough in answering our questions.  Prior to finding Julie - we had stopped at a few stores to ask questions about their saunas and we left knowing for certain that we would not purchase from them due to their lack of knowledge.  We've always felt like we've been in amazing hands with Julie.  Her knowledge is beyond what you can imagine.  After buying, there has been no drop off in her customer service either.  She still responds just as promptly and thoroughly!  So now that I've shared how much we appreciate Julie and how awesome she is at taking care of her customers, let me share my biggest health change since using the sauna.  So I suffer with CIRS (for me a combo of Lyme and mold issues) and virtually any time my heart rate came up at all (sometimes even just climbing a flight of stairs), I would get a horrible headache that would typically last the entire rest of the day.  Since starting with the sauna, I was able to shovel heavy snow for 1 1/2 hours straight 2 days in a row and NO headache either time.  It's seriously a miracle  I feel hopeful that I can once again start exercising!  I know more changes will come, and I do feel more energy during the day, so I'm excited to see what is ahead.  Thank you so much Julie!  We couldn't be happier and more thankful!\n",
