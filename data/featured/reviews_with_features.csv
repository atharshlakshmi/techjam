It's For Sale Main Account,"I wish I could give Jason and Fast Funds 10 stars for the Open & Honest way he conducted business with me.  The level of service was Exceptional.

There are many businesses designed to help people when they are in a less-than advantageous position.  Often, as customers in need of funds to sustain our living expenses we are desperate and have exhausted our resources leaving us few places to turn to and no power in the business relationship.

A businessman who suffered 3 heart failures over the last 18 months and the loss of my career as a result, this certainly was the case with me.

As a company, Fast Funds clearly understands their clientele and how to do this business right.

Design your business model in such a way that you are able to charge reasonable rates to your clients and still conduct business in a fair, ethical manner.

Hire good people with a high level of personal integrity and treat them with the same respect you insist they treat their clients with.  Pay them a wage sufficient to attract and keep quality employees and operate under a system that allows them to keep their integrity intact.

Jason was clear about the cost of the advance from the beginning.  The fee structure is easy to understand and there are no hidden charges or complicated scenarios to confuse the client.

As mentioned, the level of service was superb.  Highlighted by Jason's willingness to be helpful, answer questions, sometimes a little after hours.  He was clear about the process and what to expect without any hesitation that he may be held accountable for the statements he made.

I have been the owner of a service company with 30 employees and the manager of many others.  My name is Tom Hansen and I received my lawsuit advance December 17th, 2019.

Sister King,"To whom this may concern,
Recently, I was injured on the job. Stressed about apartment eviction and car/ insurance payments. These three are my biggest bills. After praying about my burdens, I then turned to my lawyer Mr. John Dufour. With his years of experience and affiliation with the company by the name of ""Fast Funds"" which are owned and operated by Mr. Bruce and Jason. Fast funds specializes in settlement cash advances. What does that mean? Its a financial relief for anyone who's injured. With that injury comes with a settlement offer. Well, from first hand it takes time to accumulate all the evidence in your situation. That's when hard times hit and you should contact ""Fast Funds"" where Bruce/Jason will be more than happy to assist you in your financial situation.

He answered all my questions and walked me through the whole insurance process without even expecting me to bring my car to him. It was like we had known each other for years.

The shop is a couple hours from me but was well worth the drive. I ended up having a lot of problems with my insurance company dropping the ball and jacking me around. James was super patient, helped me out a ton with all the issues, was up front about every detail, and finally my RZR came back looking like nothing ever happened even with a full frame swap. They went above and beyond to clean up all my wiring that another ""shop"" had slapped together.

Charmian McKeown,"Horrendous experience

Ordered an expensive desk from Homary and was told 9 - 11 week delivery time. It took 21 weeks. I was very happy to wait and was very understanding due to the COVID situation however when the desk finally arrived, it was only one piece, with no legs! I was then told the remaining legs would arrive in 9 - 11 weeks again, but may be longer. I could not wait another 21 weeks as I work from home and have no where to sit!

I politely asked for a refund as I couldn't wait any longer and would just purchase a cheaper desk for now that could be delivered quickly.

I have only been refunded a partial amount and no idea why, as I should get the full refund - they are now ignoring my communications.

However the most frustrating and rude part of this process is that after my understanding for 21 weeks, I asked for the large/heavy piece of unusable desk they delivered to be picked up - I cannot move it and it is taking up my entire hall. I was told I have to ""dispose of it"". I explained it is too heavy and I can't afford to get someone to come and get it, I was then told to ""Ask family or friends to help"". I have no family or friends living near me and I found this so unhelpful and pretty assumptive and upsetting. It is now sitting in my hallway as a health and safety hazard, I am £80 down as they haven't paid me a full refund and I have to order anew desk to work from after waiting 21 weeks.

I never review companies online as I understand mistakes happen but I wouldn't want anyone else to deal with this incompetent company.

Rebecca Davis,"My son, age 9, loves mix major and has really taken to making his own music! He is enrolled in an ongoing weekly group lesson with mix major and he has done one week of camp. He’s doing another week at the end of the month.

Eric/Mr Jao is a great instructor and he is so positive and encouraging with all of the kids. When they share their music he is bopping his head to their tunes. The assistants he has are great teachers as well and help the kids navigate the software. Eric also teaches some music theory and technical terms to the kids. In the camp, they make albums and my son loves sharing his album with his friends.

Ardeshir Edward Nadimi,"I was referred by a friend to Eric to help me learn how to produce electronic music.

We started with an introductory call and then an introductory course, during which he provided me direct teaching on the Ableton Live DAW to come up with a song from a prepared set of audio samples he had sent me to download prior to the session. This was all handled via the Zoom platform.

I decided to join his class on the spot, as I knew I had found someone who was very well-versed in 1-using Ableton, 2-producing electronic music, and 3-teaching.

I have been a teacher in the past, and have spent much of my adult life as a learner. It is easy for me to tell when someone has the patience, foresight, and knowledge to teach well. Eric fits the bill on all fronts.

From the music production side: I have not felt this alive in many years. Granted, I have had the goal of music production for more than a decade and I am just now getting around to seriously pursuing it. However, I think my experience is likely generalizable and not strictly confined to those who want to pursue music production seriously. The sheer act of creatively ""playing"" with music is something I think is probably built into the human psyche and human experience, and this class provides an outlet for that kind of artistic/human expression

Finally, I will say that in my brief dealings with Eric so far, I can tell that he has a kind heart and is truly trying to make the world a better -- and more music-filled -- place, one music-producer at a time.",5,"i was referred by a friend to eric to help me learn how to produce electronic music

Raquel Harp,"Leslie is not only a phenomenal photographer but she is deeply devoted to her craft and gives special attention to each of her clients. Leslie photographed a nursing session for me and my son shortly before he weaned, and those moments are absolutely precious to me as a mama who had a rough start to our nursing journey.

Such a seamless process and we loved our photos so we decided to book her for our sons 1 year pictures. Leslie was in contact with me from the start, and even helped me with ideas and offered to bring items that we needed and/or add purchases to our package.
As a working mom who had no time to plan, she made everything perfect!!! I also appreciated her honestly about timing, weather, location, cake details, outfit changes.... etc.
Fast forward to receiving our pics, I was AMAZED!! She captured EVERYTHING and made it all look absolutely perfect!!

If you’re looking for a honest, EXTREAMLY  talented photographer/storyteller.... PICK LESLIE!!
