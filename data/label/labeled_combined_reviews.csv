Derrick Phillips,Three years ago I had a car accident and I needed immediate help to cover lost wages. Fast Funds swooped in to the rescue and advanced me money to survive. It is 3 years later now my case is settled and Fast Funds got their money back. I must say that 3 years without worrying about making a loan payment or getting collection calls is well worth the fee. I absolutely love what they did to help and would recommend them to anyone waiting on the evil insurance companies to make things whole again.,5,Valid
It's For Sale Main Account,"I wish I could give Jason and Fast Funds 10 stars for the Open & Honest way he conducted business with me.  The level of service was Exceptional.

There are many businesses designed to help people when they are in a less-than advantageous position.  Often, as customers in need of funds to sustain our living expenses we are desperate and have exhausted our resources leaving us few places to turn to and no power in the business relationship.

A businessman who suffered 3 heart failures over the last 18 months and the loss of my career as a result, this certainly was the case with me.

As a company, Fast Funds clearly understands their clientele and how to do this business right.

Design your business model in such a way that you are able to charge reasonable rates to your clients and still conduct business in a fair, ethical manner.

Hire good people with a high level of personal integrity and treat them with the same respect you insist they treat their clients with.  Pay them a wage sufficient to attract and keep quality employees and operate under a system that allows them to keep their integrity intact.

Jason was clear about the cost of the advance from the beginning.  The fee structure is easy to understand and there are no hidden charges or complicated scenarios to confuse the client.

As mentioned, the level of service was superb.  Highlighted by Jason's willingness to be helpful, answer questions, sometimes a little after hours.  He was clear about the process and what to expect without any hesitation that he may be held accountable for the statements he made.

I have been the owner of a service company with 30 employees and the manager of many others.  My name is Tom Hansen and I received my lawsuit advance December 17th, 2019.  My glowing review was earned each step of the way by Jason and the good people at Fast Funds of Hollywood, Florida.",5,Valid

Sister King,"To whom this may concern,
Recently, I was injured on the job. Stressed about apartment eviction and car/ insurance payments. These three are my biggest bills. After praying about my burdens, I then turned to my lawyer Mr. John Dufour. With his years of experience and affiliation with the company by the name of ""Fast Funds"" which are owned and operated by Mr. Bruce and Jason. Fast funds specializes in settlement cash advances. What does that mean? Its a financial relief for anyone who's injured. With that injury comes with a settlement offer. Well, from first hand it takes time to accumulate all the evidence in your situation. That's when hard times hit and you should contact ""Fast Funds"" where Bruce/Jason will be more than happy to assist you in your financial situation. If it wasn't for these three Angels I would be homeless, Literally! God places people in your life for a reason and these three Angels have been a blessing to my life. So stop worrying about what's already been solved. Go ahead and give ""Fast Funds"" a try Today!",5,Ad

Seth Walker,"I have always admired AO's builds and had one day hoped to get my car in their shop for upgrades. Before I could do that, I ran out of talent and wadded up the front end on my RZR cracking the frame in the process. I called Alternative the following day (on a Sunday) and surprisingly James answered my call. He answered all my questions and walked me through the whole insurance process without even expecting me to bring my car to him. It was like we had known each other for years.

The shop is a couple hours from me but was well worth the drive. I ended up having a lot of problems with my insurance company dropping the ball and jacking me around. James was super patient, helped me out a ton with all the issues, was up front about every detail, and finally my RZR came back looking like nothing ever happened even with a full frame swap. They went above and beyond to clean up all my wiring that another ""shop"" had slapped together.

Their pics speak for themselves. Believe me when I say their work is very clean and thorough. Solid team of guys that do things right the first time. Extremely hard to find in this industry.

Highly recommend!",5,Valid

Charmian McKeown,"Horrendous experience

Ordered an expensive desk from Homary and was told 9 - 11 week delivery time. It took 21 weeks. I was very happy to wait and was very understanding due to the COVID situation however when the desk finally arrived, it was only one piece, with no legs! I was then told the remaining legs would arrive in 9 - 11 weeks again, but may be longer. I could not wait another 21 weeks as I work from home and have no where to sit!

I politely asked for a refund as I couldn't wait any longer and would just purchase a cheaper desk for now that could be delivered quickly.

I have only been refunded a partial amount and no idea why, as I should get the full refund - they are now ignoring my communications.

However the most frustrating and rude part of this process is that after my understanding for 21 weeks, I asked for the large/heavy piece of unusable desk they delivered to be picked up - I cannot move it and it is taking up my entire hall. I was told I have to ""dispose of it"". I explained it is too heavy and I can't afford to get someone to come and get it, I was then told to ""Ask family or friends to help"". I have no family or friends living near me and I found this so unhelpful and pretty assumptive and upsetting. It is now sitting in my hallway as a health and safety hazard, I am ¬£80 down as they haven't paid me a full refund and I have to order anew desk to work from after waiting 21 weeks.

I never review companies online as I understand mistakes happen but I wouldn't want anyone else to deal with this incompetent company.

They brought at least 6 fans and several extra humidifiers they charged insurance extra for which were never working.

They stole military service medals, sunglasses, and several other small items. When I confronted the head technician David Renteria, he said they broke into my garage to use the power outlet.

Kirsten Reeder,"Our son likes making music, so we signed him up for a summer camp at Mix Major. He loved it! The teaching of skills and interaction with other kids was great for him. He's now taking weekly classes, has created several songs, and because of what he's learned and the confidence it's given him he created an entire album of music. We love that the students use professional software and are learning skills that are up to date and used is the music production industry today.

Eric truly cares for his students and that's what makes him and his school so special.",5,Valid
George Cheng,"Our child has really enjoyed Mix Major's DJ'ing/music production program!  It started with a summer camp a few summers ago but since we are not local, we could not attend the regular weekday classes.  It was great to see Eric be so adaptive during the pandemic and really grow his online platform to allow our child to now attend the weekly classes.  There aren't too many silver linings from this pandemic but this is one of few.  It's neat to see kids with similar music interests from all over the country now in these classes.  Eric has also arranged, from time to time, extra workshops exposing the students to a variety of people in the music industry which gives the students a wider perspective of real life applications that are possible from these classes.  Our child in general would not sit still long enough to appreciate regular musical instrument lessons but this program has helped to increase the interest in music. Our piano is getting more use now and  there is a much higher level of excitement for orchestra class in middle school.  Who know where this class can take our child, but the new appreciation for music and instruments makes the program well worth it.",5,Valid

Eric/Mr Jao is a great instructor and he is so positive and encouraging with all of the kids. When they share their music he is bopping his head to their tunes. The assistants he has are great teachers as well and help the kids navigate the software. Eric also teaches some music theory and technical terms to the kids. In the camp, they make albums and my son loves sharing his album with his friends.

Ardeshir Edward Nadimi,"I was referred by a friend to Eric to help me learn how to produce electronic music.

We started with an introductory call and then an introductory course, during which he provided me direct teaching on the Ableton Live DAW to come up with a song from a prepared set of audio samples he had sent me to download prior to the session. This was all handled via the Zoom platform.

I decided to join his class on the spot, as I knew I had found someone who was very well-versed in 1-using Ableton, 2-producing electronic music, and 3-teaching.

I have been a teacher in the past, and have spent much of my adult life as a learner. It is easy for me to tell when someone has the patience, foresight, and knowledge to teach well. Eric fits the bill on all fronts.

From the music production side: I have not felt this alive in many years. Granted, I have had the goal of music production for more than a decade and I am just now getting around to seriously pursuing it. However, I think my experience is likely generalizable and not strictly confined to those who want to pursue music production seriously. The sheer act of creatively ""playing"" with music is something I think is probably built into the human psyche and human experience, and this class provides an outlet for that kind of artistic/human expression

Finally, I will say that in my brief dealings with Eric so far, I can tell that he has a kind heart and is truly trying to make the world a better -- and more music-filled -- place, one music-producer at a time.",5,Irrelevant

Such a seamless process and we loved our photos so we decided to book her for our sons 1 year pictures. Leslie was in contact with me from the start, and even helped me with ideas and offered to bring items that we needed and/or add purchases to our package.
As a working mom who had no time to plan, she made everything perfect!!! I also appreciated her honestly about timing, weather, location, cake details, outfit changes.... etc.
Fast forward to receiving our pics, I was AMAZED!! She captured EVERYTHING and made it all look absolutely perfect!!

If you‚Äôre looking for a honest, EXTREAMLY  talented photographer/storyteller.... PICK LESLIE!!

Thanks Leslie!!",5,Valid

Motorhead883_,"What can I say. My experience was amazing. My wife and I hired leslie back in 2018 when my daughter was born for newborn pictures. Leslie when out of her way to meet us as the hospital and take pictures there since my wife had to go into surgery after giving birth. Well the pictures were amazing, she understood the pain my wife was in. We did not feel rushed or anything in the contrary she offered to help however she could. Would hire again but we are no longer on island.",5,Valid

Norma Carranza,"We had a maternity photoshoot with Leslie this past weekend at sunset, and love her! She was focused on us and committed to us from the moment I asked her about her services. The communication was great throughout the whole service. Upon arrival to the shoot, she was ready for us. She had all the props, a portable changing station, the outfits and she was ready when we were. I was so nervous to be taking pictures with my husband. The last time we had pictures taken were for our wedding day, but she had us feel comfortable, confident and really helped my husband and I find that connection that will stay with us in these pictures. After the shoot, she made sure to answer any questions we had and let us know when to expect the pictures. When I got the email that my photos were ready to view, all i could say was WOW! i mean, they were stunning.. she captured every emotion, and perfect imperfect moments of our shoot that really screamed us! I ended up buying extra prints, it was so hard to choose. Leslie is Magical! Super professional, sweet and dedicated. I would recommend her to everyone!",5,Valid
Michelle Tahamont,"Leslie is so amazing! I reached out to her for a breastfeeding photoshoot to capture the bond I have with my baby, and man did she capture it! She made me feel so comfortable, which I didn't think was possible, and she is so accommodating. I had a vision in mind, and she was able to capture it beautifully. We definitely are going to use her for any photography needs until one of us leaves the island!",5,Valid

Teijah Armbruster,"Leslie had just finished a newborn photography workshop and was looking for newborns to add to her profile. We were one of the lucky few chosen and I had such an amazing first experience with her during our photoshoot. She invited me into her home studio and made sure my daughter was warm (multiple heaters) and comfortable (swaddled baby). I loved how patient she was when the baby got hungry, when she got squirmy she rocked her around before we continued with the pictures. I didn't have to bring any props/clothes, Leslie had a lot of equipment and knew how to do the baby poses.",5,Valid
